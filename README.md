The program takes in an words array (const char*) and outputs a char array with all the words padded to the length of the longest word. 
For example: ("None", "Critical", "Error", "Warning", "Debug", "Info", "All") 
gets padded to: [  None  ][Critical][ Error  ][Warning ][ Debug  ][  Info  ][  All   ] 
(The square brackets are added to make it easier to see the spaces between different words.)
